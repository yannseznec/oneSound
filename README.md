 one button sampler rhythm making thing

make sure your audio is on and then just click the toggle while you make noise. while the toggle is on it records, while the toggle is off it plays. you can't really stop it playing without also recording once you get started. 

nothing fancy going on here, i just thought it would be a fun thing to try and throw together. 

it could definitely use a lot more features, maybe i'll do them one day! or maybe not. 

you can use this on a Bela (you'll have to rename the main patch to _main.pd). Attach a button to input pin 12.
